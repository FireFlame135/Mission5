            Rocket League is a competitive game that combines soccer
            with rocket-powered cars that can fly. Success depends on strong mechanics,
            smart positioning, and great decision-making.

            I’ve spent thousands of hours improving across multiple ranks and
            learning what separates average players from ones that are consistently great.

            Through personalized tutoring, I help players understand rotations,
            boost management, and mechanical fundamentals like aerials and
            ball control.
